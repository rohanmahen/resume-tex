# Resume-Tex Template

Welcome to the `resume-tex` repository, here you can find my old résumé template. This template was carefully crafted to balance aesthetics and readability, making my resume stand out. It actually landed me my first job in Finance! I hope you find it a good starting point, if anything, for your own resume.

## Features

- **Customizable Layout:** The template is structured with flexibility in mind, allowing you to adjust sections according to your professional experience and educational background.
- **Elegant Typography:** Utilizes a combination of `Open Sans` and `Source Sans Pro` fonts to ensure your resume is as pleasant to read as it is to look at.
- **Microtype Adjustments:** Enhanced typography settings such as letter spacing, kerning, and tracking for improved text appearance.
- **Simplified Commands:** Custom commands for streamlined document formatting, enabling you to focus on the content rather than the layout.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this template, ensure you have LaTeX installed on your system. You can download LaTeX from [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) for Unix/Linux, [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS, or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows.

## How to Use

This LaTeX resume template is designed to be easy to customize and compile, even for those new to LaTeX. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a professional-looking resume.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, you need to get a copy of this template onto your local machine. To do this, navigate to the GitHub page for this repository and look for the "Clone or download" button. You can clone the repository using Git by opening your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and running the following command:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/rohanmahen/resume-tex.git
```

### Step 2: Edit the Template

Open the `resume.tex` file in a LaTeX editor of your choice. Some popular LaTeX editors include TeXstudio, Overleaf (an online LaTeX editor), and Visual Studio Code with a LaTeX extension installed.

Once open, you'll see various sections pre-defined in the template, such as Education, Work Experience, and Skills. Replace the placeholder text with your own information. The template is designed with comments to guide you through customizing each section.

### Step 3: Customize Your Resume

As you fill out your personal and professional details, you may also want to adjust the layout or styling. The template uses LaTeX commands for easy modifications. For instance, you can change the font size, adjust margins, or reorder sections to better suit your content.

### Step 4: Compile the Resume

After customizing the template, you need to compile it to generate the `resume.pdf` file. This can be done directly from your LaTeX editor—most editors have a "Build" or "Compile" button.

Alternatively, if you prefer to compile from the command line, navigate to the directory containing your `resume.tex` file in the terminal and run:

```zsh
pdflatex resume.tex
```

This command will create a `resume.pdf` file in the same directory.

### Step 5: Review and Distribute

Open the generated `resume.pdf` file to review your resume. Make sure all the information is correct and that the layout looks as expected.

## Customization

You can easily modify this template to suit your needs. Feel free to adjust the margins, font sizes, and section headings as desired. The template uses simple LaTeX commands, making it accessible even for those new to LaTeX.
